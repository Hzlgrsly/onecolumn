	<p>Hi all, my name is Hazel and I'm from Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º</p>
	<p>Welcome to my first experience creating platforms with CSS and HTML. </p>
	<p>I've always been interested in creative design and wanted to further my skills </p>
	<p>and experience in the field. I have a cert 2 in Graphics Design and </p>
	<p>have also worked for a multimedia studio called Interlusion. </p>
<p>I have a diploma in Beauty Therapy and a diploma in Management.</p>
	<p>I joined SheCodes as a hobby to expand my current skills with web</p>
	<p>development and coding, with the overall goal of becoming a </p>
		<p>freelance web designer.
