<p>  <h5>Hi all, my name is Hazel and I'm from Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º</h5>
  <p>Welcome to my first experience creating platforms with CSS and HTML. 
I've always been interested in creative design and wanted to further my skills and experience in the field.  
I have a cert 2 in Graphics Design and have also worked for a multimedia studio called Interlusion. 
I have a diploma in Beauty Therapy and a diploma in Management.</p>
<p>I joined SheCodes as a hobby to expand my current skills with web development and coding, 
with the overall goal of becoming a freelance web designer. I strive to achieve what I am passionate about in 
life and aim to be the best version I can be.</p>
